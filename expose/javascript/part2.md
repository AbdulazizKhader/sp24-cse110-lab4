## Question 1
It prints out 2, since ```var``` is function-specific, so the variable i can be seen in the whole function.

## Question 2
It prints out 150, since ```var``` is function-specific, so the variable discountedPrice can be seen in the whole function.

## Question 3
It prints out 150 since the final price was the discounted price rounded to the nearest whole number, and since ```var``` is function-specific, so the variable finalPrice can be seen in the whole function.

## Question 4
It will return the array ```[50, 100, 150]```. It discounts the elements of the input array by the given percent (in decimal form) and output the final price.

## Question 5
It would cause an error, since ```i``` is not available to the program outside of the ```for``` loop.

## Question 6
It would cause an error, since ```discountedPrice``` is not available to the program outside of the ```for``` loop.

## Question 7
It would output 150, since ```finalPrice``` was declared outside of the ```for``` loop, so the program can access it outside of the loop.

## Question 8
It will return the array ```[50, 100, 150]```. It discounts the elements of the input array by the given percent (in decimal form) and output the final price.

## Question 9
The code causes an error; you cannot modify the value of a ```const``` variable after you defined it, so the code crashes before outputting the value of ```i```.

## Question 10
The code causes an error; you cannot modify the value of a ```const``` variable after you defined it, so the code crashes before outputting the value of ```length```.

## Question 11
The code causes an error; you cannot modify the value of a ```const``` variable after you defined it, so the code crashes before getting to the return statement.

## Question 12
